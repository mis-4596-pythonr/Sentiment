# Sentiment
This code analyzes how to load twitter data from a csv format, clean the data from http links, hashtags, mentions, and files, tokenize the data and remove stopwords (common, meaningless words in the english language). The code then will graph the text into wordclouds, as well as histograms to compare the word frequency and sentiment behind the tweets for different airline companies.
